# Grant Black

Hands-on fullstack engineer with 14+ years building production systems where correctness and reliability matter.  
I build primarily in TypeScript with Next.js and Node, and I care a lot about clean architecture, TDD, and shipping software that holds up in production.

## What I work with
- TypeScript, JavaScript (ES6+)
- Next.js, React, component-driven UI
- Node.js APIs and service workflows
- AWS serverless patterns (API Gateway, Lambda)
- TDD and quality-focused delivery

## Featured projects
- **demo-site** — Next.js + Strapi monorepo showing modern fullstack patterns (API-driven content, UI, data flows)
- **lee-county-property-scraper** — serverless API with tests and deploy workflow
- **gdb-component-library** — reusable React component library written in TypeScript
