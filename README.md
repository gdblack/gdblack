# Yo, I'm Grant.

I’m a hands-on engineering leader with 14+ years in fullstack development. I’ve gone from building day-to-day features to modernizing SaaS platforms and distributed systems used by millions of employees, where reliability and clarity really matter.

These days I’m focused on building practical systems in TypeScript with Next.js and Node, and keeping things simple, clean, and shippable.

I’m also exploring the more creative side of technology. I like building things that tell stories and bring a little more of the human side back into software.

Currently building: small fullstack apps and tools that mix practical engineering with storytelling.
